        Parcel uses this cache to speed up subsequent builds by reusing previously compiled files and avoiding unnecessary work. By caching these files, Parcel can avoid recompiling everything from scratch every time you make changes to your code, which can significantly reduce build times.

    What is npx ?
        NPX stands for Node Package eXecute. It is simply an NPM package runner. It allows developers to execute any Javascript Package available on the NPM registry without even installing it.

    What is difference between dependencies vs devDependencies

    What is Tree Shaking?
        Tree shaking is a technique used by modern JavaScript bundlers to eliminate dead code or unused modules from the final production build. It is also known as dead code elimination. This technique is essential to reduce the size of the bundle file, which improves the performance of the application.


    What is Hot Module Replacement?
        Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature in web development that allows developers to update the code of a running application without having to refresh the page. With HMR, developers can see changes they make to the code almost immediately, which can save them a significant amount of time during the development process.


    List down your favorite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your own words.

    What is the difference between package.json and package-lock.json
        package.json gives us the meta data of the project, like name, url, author, description, scripts, dependencies etc.
        package-lock.json, is a file that is automatically generated when you run npm install or yarn install. It is used to keep track of the exact version of each dependency that is installed, including its sub-dependencies. This is important to ensure that everyone working on the project is using the same versions of dependencies, which can help prevent version conflicts and ensure that the project runs correctly.

    Why should I not modify package-lock.json?
        never. as it is auto-generated, can cause conflict with the other developers working on that project. and we might lose the exact version that we were using for this project


    What is node_modules ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?\

    What is the dist folder?
        The "dist" folder is short for "distribution" folder and it usually contains the compiled, minified, and optimized code of a software project or application created by the Bundler.

    What is browserlists?
        Browserlist is a tool that helps developers specify which browsers they want to support with their website or application.
